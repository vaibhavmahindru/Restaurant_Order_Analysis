# Restaurant Order Analysis 

## Project Overview:
The Taste of the World Caf√©, is a fricitonal restaurant that has diverse menu offerings and serves generous portions. The Taste of the World Cafe debuted a new menu at the start of the year (2023). The aim of the project is to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best


## Objectives:

**OBJECTIVE 1:** 

Exlpore the items table. To better understand the items table, find the number of rows in the table, the least and most expensive items, and the item prices with each category.

**OBJECTIVE 2:**

Exlpore the orders table. To better understand the orders table, find the fate range, the number of items within each order, and the orders with the highest number of items.

**OBJECTIVE 3:** 

Analyze customer behavior. Combine the items and orders tables, find the least and most ordered categories, and explore the details of the highest spend orders. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?

**Tools:** 
- POSTgreSQL for data analysis

## Insights and Recommendations: 
- There are 32 items on the menu with them most expensive item being $19.95 for Shrimp Scampi, and the least expensive $5.00 for Edamame. 
- The most ordered item was hamburger with 622 purchases in American category and the least ordered item was chicken tacos with 123 purchases in Mexican category. The company should consider removing chicken tacos from the menu. 
- The top 5 highest spend orders were between $185 - $192. Each of the four top spend orders contained 14 menu items, while one had 13 menus.
- Based on the orders and revenue, these menu items Hamburger & Cheeseburger (American), Korean beef bowl & Tofu pad Thai (Asian), Spaghetti & Meatballs (Italian), and Steak Torta (Mexican) are menus worth keeping and developing in each cuisine class.
- The analysis reveals that customers have a strong preference for italian dishes, despite their higher price point. This has implications for menu planning and inventory management.
